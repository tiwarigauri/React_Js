# React_Js
This repository contains my Reactjs code journey.
<!-- commands written below-
npm init
npm install -D parcel 
npx parcel index.html
-->
<!-- Package.json file is a configuration of npm inside my project like we do the configuration of git using git init, similarly we did npm init here also. 

cdn links is not a good way to get react into our projects because it will make network calls everytime so that's not a right thing.
